<h2>About Me</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
  Hello! I'm Zhaohong Liu, a researcher/developer in Robotics.
  M.Sc. student in Mechanical Engineering at SJTU with expertise in quadrotor motion planning, reinforcement learning, and UAV autonomy. Experienced in full-stack development for aerial robotics systems, including perception, planning, control and hardware integration. Aspiring to pursue a Ph.D. focusing on AI-driven autonomous (aerial) robots in interactive tasks, particularly in learning-based interactive planning, manipulation and real-world deployment.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #A50044;">
  I'm currently looking for Ph.D. positions starting from Fall 2025 and Spring 2026. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me.
